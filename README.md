This code starts a mini-game on Android in which we can move a ball on our phone using a gyroscope (there is also a click counter inside as a test).

ðŸ‘¾TO RUN:
Android Studio 2023.3.1 was used for development, you can start the program by loading the code and starting it.
You can play it directly by connecting an Android phone or by starting a virtual session on the IDE.
I recommend keeping the same versions of the IDE indicated, in order not to encounter errors.
